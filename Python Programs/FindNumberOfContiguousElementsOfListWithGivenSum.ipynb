    "The time complexity of method 2 looks more than O(n), but if we take a closer look at the program, then we can figure out the time complexity is O(n). We can prove it by counting the number of operations performed on every element of arr[] in the worst case. There are at most 2 operations performed on every element: (a) the element is added to the curr_sum (b) the element is subtracted from curr_sum. So the upper bound on the number of operations is 2n which is O(n)"
